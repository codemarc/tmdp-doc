# Terminology

## AI - What is AI (artificial intelligence)

Artificial intelligence is a machineâ€™s ability to perform some cognitive functions we usually associate with human minds.

## AGI - What is artificial general intelligence?

The phrase "artificial general intelligence" (AGI) is used to refer to AI systems that have abilities on par with those of humans. Ideally, AGI would be able to mimic human cognitive functions such as reasoning, problem-solving, perception, learning, and understanding language. However, it's important to note that this is a future goal. The majority of researchers and academics think that AGI is still many decades away; some even speculate that it won't be achieved within this century, if at all.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) describes algorithms (such as ChatGPT) that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos. Recent breakthroughs in the field have the potential to drastically change the way we approach content creation.w
