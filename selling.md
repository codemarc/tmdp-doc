## Selling
I have a who is a great salesman and watching him I have come to the conclusion that the best salespeople are really good at few important things:

1. Asking Questions
2. Listening
3. Making People Feel Understood
4. Making People Feel Like Your Care

To close deals you must be able to make the 3 transfers

1. Trust 
2. Confidence
3. Energy

So with this in mind when the very same friend approached me with his idea about the milagro shop and hit me with the trust built over a lifetime, confidence that he could easily sell the goods he was so excited about and the energy of the actual rock star that he is, I felt compelled to offer my help as a skilled software artizan.
